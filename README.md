Title: ETYM an etymology tracking application

Introduction: 

The purpose of this application is to give users a place to record their findings when researching etymology online. 

The user can compare their word list to those of other users. 

The user can save words and their origins to their unique list by logging into their account. Or delete the words from their list if they wish.

Stretch Goals:

* build out more seamless navigation

* hyperlinks for individual words that navigate to a new page with details such as the date the word was added to the list, how the user feels (positively/ negatively) about the word, a space for additional information or links to sources for future reference

* listing other users words on a separate page, while having the initial user page be clean and unique to them

* create Admin priveleges who can delete users if needed
